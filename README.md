# Arquivo.pt web archive: open source and API

The main goal of the [Arquivo.pt](http://www.arquivo.pt) web archive is to preserve and provide access to web content that is longer available online on their original websites. Arquivo.pt was formerly known as the Portuguese web-archive (PWA), this the name "pwa-technologies" for our main repository.

The search services provided by Arquivo.pt include full-text and image search, version history listing, advanced search and application programming interfaces (API) that facilitate the development of added-value applications by third parties. 

Our [GitHub account arquivo](https://github.com/arquivo/) aggregates source code and technical documentation about the several components of our service. 

We are a public service funded by public grants and all the output is publicly available in open-access.
